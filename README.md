# Unity Chess

This project is a chess learning app that contains tutorials and AI opponents. It was developed entirely in Unity and served as my Diploma Project.

## Installation

### Option 1 (harder)
- Clone the entire repo and import into a new Unity Project.
- Play directly in the editor or build the project
- Choose this option if you want to look at the code or are a developer yourself and wish to play around

### Option 2 (simpler)
- Download `UnityChess.zip` and extract
- Run `Unity Chess.exe`
- Choose this if you simply wish to play the game

## Documentation
- Please see `Diploma Paper.pdf`
