# Unity Chess

This project is a chess learning app that contains tutorials and AI opponents. It was developed entirely in Unity and served as my Diploma Project.

## Installation

### Option 1 (harder)
Choose this option if you want to look at the code or are a developer yourself and wish to play around.
- clone the entire repo and import into a new Unity Project
- play directly in the editor or build the project

### Option 2 (simpler)
Choose this option if you simply wish to play the game.
- download `UnityChess.zip` and extract
- run `Unity Chess.exe`
  

## Documentation
